# ðŸ“Š Irelandâ€™s Export Analysis â€“ Machine Learning Insights  

This project analyzes Ireland's **commodity and service exports** from **2015 to 2023**, identifying key trade partners and predicting future trends using machine learning.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Steps  
âœ” **Data Cleaning & Preparation** â€“ Processed datasets, removed inconsistencies, and standardized data.  
âœ” **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Identified top exported commodities and services, annual trends, and major trade partners.  

## ðŸ”¹ Machine Learning Models  
ðŸ“Œ **SARIMA & ARIMA** â€“ Forecasted commodity and service export trends.  
ðŸ“Œ **K-Means Clustering** â€“ Grouped countries and commodities by similar trade patterns.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights  
âœ” **Pharmaceuticals and technology** are Irelandâ€™s top export sectors.  
âœ” **The USA, Belgium, and Germany** are the main trade partners.  
âœ” **Clustering revealed four distinct trade patterns**, showing key country-commodity relationships.  
âœ” **Machine learning predicts continued export growth** in the coming years.  

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used
